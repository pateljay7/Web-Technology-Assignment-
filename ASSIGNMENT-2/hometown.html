			Bharuch in Gujarat, 192 km south of Ahmedabad, is today an industrial town known for 
			chemical and fertiliser plants and textile mills. But can you imagine that it is also the second 
			oldest city in India after Varanasi, continuously inhabited for at least 2,500 years!<br><br><br>

			According to the Skanda Purana, one of the 18 Hindu religious texts known as the Puranas,
			Bharuch, or 'Bhrigukachcha' as it was known, was named after a sage Bhrigu, who is said to 
			have lived here. Sage Bhrigu, a scholar in astronomy and medicine, is considered to be one of
			the seven most important sages of the Hindu religious tradition (the Saptarishis).
